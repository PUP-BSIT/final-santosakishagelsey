      <h2>"Why conduct F2F instead of online class"</h2>
      <p>
        Both DIT 2-1 and BSIT 3-1 conducted a face to face class instead of
        online class. I support having face to face classes than onlince classes
        because it can offer several advantages over online classes, primarily
        due to the interpersonal interaction and immersive learning experiences
        they provide. Here are some key reasons why face-to-face classes are
        important.
      </p>
      <p>
        An online course. Personally, I believe that in-person training is
        better than online instruction. because it can have a lot of advantages.
        over online education, major among them. due to group discussions and
        hands-on learning opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being physically present in a classroom environment can help students
        stay focused and engaged in the learning process. The structured
        environment of a classroom can reduce distractions and create a
        conducive atmosphere for learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        While online programs are flexible and convenient, face-to-face Classes
        offer distinct features that cannot be fully recreated in a In a virtual
        environment. By integrating the advantages of both approaches, Educators
        can design unique learning experiences that address the Students have
        different needs.

    <h3>"SEE YOURSELF 5 YEARS FROM NOW"</h3>
    <p>
      I can see myself 5 years from now being financially stable in life since 
      that's really my goal and that's why at the time that I turned 18, first
      thing that came to my mind is applying for a job to start saving money so 
      since first cut off on the payroll that I got is I'm really saving it half
      by half amount every cut off and I know that one day, I will be using my 
      savings on important things that I'll be needing to spend money to and 
      especially to my future family.
      5 years from now, I want to have a successful business that will help me 
      to have a financially stable life. But if I will be lucky to learn a lot of 
      things on I.T industry and I can apply it to the future job that I will be
      having. But seriously, I don't know yet on what's speciic job on I.T industry
      I will be in, but the most thing that I'm interested and I love doing is 
      creating database works on SQL and I still want to know more about other 
      database softwares.
